Given two integers `a` and `b`, return their sum **without using the `+` or `-` operators**.

## Requirements

Implement a function that:

- Takes two integers `a` and `b` as input
- Returns their sum
- **Cannot use the `+` or `-` operators anywhere in your solution**

## Examples

```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: 1 + 2 = 3

Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: 2 + 3 = 5

Input: a = -1, b = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: -1 + 1 = 0

Input: a = 15, b = 7
Output: 22
Explanation: 15 + 7 = 22
```

## Constraints

- -1000 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000
- The use of `+`, `-`, `+=`, `-=`, `++`, `--` operators is **strictly forbidden**
- Your solution will be validated by checking the source code for prohibited operators
